I am currently working as a Junior Software Engineer at <a href="//www.mywebgrocer.com">MyWebGrocer</a>. As part of my Senior Capstone project, I worked on Sagittarii Run, a trans-dimensional arcade racing game. To keep my programming skills sharp I solve Project Euler problems. My favorite languages are C#, C++, and JavaScript. I also play the trumpet, 6 string guitar, and bass guitar. With the knowledge that I have gained through my experience and education, I am excited to make a significant contribution to the video game industry.</p>
