<p>During my studies at Champlain and in my work experience, I have learned how to utilize many different languages, APIs, and tools. The ever-changing nature of the game industry excites me, and pushes me to learn and master any and all new tools available to me. This has enabled me to develop creative and innovative solutions to the unique and complex problems I have faced when making games. Also, I am proficient in the use of project management tools, such as Git and Subversion, after having used them while working on many different teams.</p>
<p>Having worked on a variety of projects, I have had the opportunity to work alone, as a member of a team, and as the leader of a team. Working on projects by myself has allowed me the freedom to dive deep into uncharted territory and experiment with unorthodox solutions. I have also acted as a cooperative team member, able to give and take directions and feedback, in the pursuit of a shared vision. My experience as lead programmer, on Conquest, has taught me how to effectively communicate ideas and instructions to a team and how to create a dialogue with my coworkers to ensure a high quality end product.</p>
